There are many different ways to prepare tea, depending on the type of tea and your personal preferences. However, here is a basic guide on how to prepare a simple cup of tea:

1. Start by boiling water in a kettle. The temperature of the water will vary depending on the type of tea you are using (see below for specific recommendations).

2. While the water is boiling, place a tea bag or loose tea leaves in a teapot or mug. If using loose tea leaves, you may want to use a tea infuser to contain the leaves.

3. Once the water reaches the desired temperature, pour it over the tea bag or leaves in the teapot or mug.

4. Let the tea steep for the recommended amount of time. This will vary depending on the type of tea and your personal taste preferences. Generally, black teas should steep for 3-5 minutes, green teas for 2-3 minutes, and herbal teas for 5-7 minutes.

5. Remove the tea bag or infuser from the teapot or mug.

6. Add any desired sweeteners or milk to the tea, if desired.

7. Stir the tea and enjoy!

Specific recommendations for water temperature based on tea type:

- Black tea: 200°F (boiling water)
- Green tea: 175-190°F (let boiling water cool for a few minutes before pouring over tea)
- White tea: 160-180°F (let boiling water cool for a few minutes before pouring over tea)
- Oolong tea: 185-205°F (boiling water)
- Herbal tea: 212°F (boiling water)

Remember that these are general guidelines and you may need to adjust based on personal preference. Enjoy your tea!
